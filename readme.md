# local-photos

Open a ðŸ“‚ local folder with images from your computer. View the photos or start a slideshow. See [local-photos.web.app](https://local-photos.web.app).

## Why?

I wanted to display a simple slideshow of some photos on a screen via my Windows 11 laptop. But the latest and greatest default Windows 11 setup doesn't have a Photos app with slideshow functionality. You should install the "Photos Legacy" app from the store if you wanted that. ðŸ¤”
Web apps first! So I quickly searched for a web app that just showed my local photos in some sort of slideshow. Couldn't find one, so created it myself. ðŸ˜…

Currently it only works in Chromium desktop browsers, using the File System API. I know, this is a pretty narrow usecase ðŸ˜„

## How?

Created with [WMR](https://wmr.dev) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com) - great to quickly create something out of nothing!

I also needed a folder icon. So I figured I could lend the one from Microsoft as they started my little problem solving project ðŸ˜œ
